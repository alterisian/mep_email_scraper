title: "List of e-mail addresses of MEPs"

The following script will try to scape a list of MEPs for their e-mails found at [this address](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/full-list.html?filter=all&leg=). [This](https://github.com/romunov/mep_email_scraper/blob/master/meps.txt) is the result, with an e-mail friendy version which can be found [here](https://github.com/romunov/mep_email_scraper/blob/master/email_friendly.txt). Source code can be [found here](https://github.com/romunov/mep_email_scraper/blob/master/source_code_mep_scraper.R).

For this method to work, in addition to what is loaded in the script below, you will need to have [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) installed and in your PATH or somehow visible to the `system()` call.

This list was scraped in March 2016 and the file is available in the repository `<> Code`. If you need to update it, feel free to scrape it again.

NOTE: Some members do not have an email listed and others have more than one, which is why there are more than 751 contacts.
